        <h1> NORWOOD INTERNATION HIGH SCHOOL üè´</h1>
        <p> Meet our Principal
            Welcome to Norwood International High School!

            We are delighted to welcome you to the Norwood International High School website. Over the past two years,
            Norwood
            International High School has undergone a significant and exciting transformation. Not only have we
            co-located onto one
            site, introduced Year 7 students, expanded our internationalized curriculum, and created stunning new
            learning spaces,
            but we have also changed our name to reflect our new location and, most importantly, our global outlook and
            commitment
            to international-mindedness in all its forms.

            Norwood International High School is truly enjoying a new beginning with a successful past and an exciting
            future.

            Our school community is dedicated to upholding our celebrated traditions while developing engaged global
            citizens who
            can make a positive difference in this fast-changing world. We value the unique skills, talents, and
            interests that each
            student brings and strive to personalize their learning experience. Along the way, our students are
            supported by expert
            teachers who inspire a passion for deep and lifelong learning, help stretch their abilities, and empower
            them to
            discover their potential and futures.
            Learning extends beyond the classroom with a wide array of co-curricular opportunities. In fact, we offer
            something for
            everyone, whether it be lunchtime clubs, sports teams, music ensembles and bands, rowing, pedal prix, school
            musicals,
            debating, or service-learning initiatives.
            A key feature of our school is the way we value and celebrate diversity. Students from a wide range of
            cultural and
            linguistic backgrounds respect and learn from each other. This is supported by our international curriculum,
            which
            actively promotes international-mindedness and global perspectives. We also have intercultural celebrations,
            sister
            school partnerships, outbound study tours, and our highly acclaimed international student program. As a
            globally
            connected school, we are accredited by the Council of International Schools and the International
            Baccalaureate
            Organisation for meeting international standards and delivering world-class learning opportunities.
            Regardless of what your passion, talents, and career aspirations may be, you can find your special place at
            Norwood
            International High School‚Äîa place to grow, learn, and discover!

        <h1>Learning At NIHS üìö</h1>

        <p> <b>Middle Schooling </b>
            Our Middle Schooling philosophy provides a supportive and dynamic environment that promotes a culture of
            engagement,
            self-directed learning and achievement. Years 7-9 students undertake a broad program of study and experience
            a variety
            of subjects within the International Baccalaureate Middle Years Program (IB:MYP).
            ‚Äã
            It provides a framework of learning and encourages students to become ‚Äúinquiring, knowledgeable and caring
            young people
            who help to create a better and more peaceful world through intercultural understanding and respect‚Äù
            (International
            Baccalaureate Organisation Mission Statement). Students study a Language to support them in understanding
            their own
            language and culture and those of others.

            In the final year of the program, all students complete a personal project. This engaging curriculum ensures
            excellence
            in academic, social and cultural outcomes and encourages students to become creative, critical and
            reflective thinkers.
        </p>

        <p> <b> Senior Schooling</b>
            Norwood International High School has a success-oriented culture offering diverse learning programs and
            pathways to
            develop expert learners and provide for individual interests.
            ‚Äã
            The Senior School builds on the independent learning skills and learning experiences of the Middle School
            and
            effectively prepares students to graduate as engaged global citizens ready to meet the challenges of a
            changing world.
            ‚Äã
            We are passionate about providing a personalised, engaging, futures-focused curriculum that develops our
            students
            academically, socially and emotionally to become active, life-long learners. As such, our senior students
            have access to
            relevant, contemporary and high-quality senior secondary education. As a pathway to school completion,
            senior students
            have the choice to undertake the South Australian Certificate of Education (SACE) or the International
            Baccalaureate
            Diploma Programme (DP). Our senior schooling philosophy and structures are student-centred and cater for the
            differences
            in adolescent interest and development. We effectively empower, challenge and support our students to
            develop their
            unique qualities and talents.
            ‚Äã
            The Senior School affords several specialist programs with purpose-built facilities and teaching expertise.
            Staff have a
            wealth of knowledge and experience and understand the challenges and complexities of senior schooling. They
            work
            collaboratively with parents, students and providers to ensure the best possible outcomes for all students.

            a proud and long-standing tradition of academic and industry excellence with graduates achieving outstanding
            subject and
